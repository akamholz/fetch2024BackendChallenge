1. I used Node.js and Express to develop this API. I used these because they are simple and lightweight, making it easy and efficient to create a small project such as this one.
I utilized Insomnia to send HTTP requests and test my project. I used Insomnia because I was familiar with it, but also because it is very easy to use.

2. The advantages of my solution is that the code itself is short and easy to understand. 
I believe this is highlighted by the extensive commenting that explains what certain code does and the significance of methods/variables.
I also believe my solution is correct and efficient for solving the provided problem. Each request runs in O(nlogn) or O(1), making for quick response times.
The disadvantages of my solution is that certain edge cases that were not specified in the project description may result in unexpected behavior. 
For example, if negative balances or negative spend requests could result in unexpected behavior.

3. My favorite project thus far has been my Employee Trivia application. 
During my internship this most recent summer, I created a web application that allowed employees to be quizzed on fun facts about thier fellow employees.
The most challenging thing about this project was that I did it exclusively in Angular/TypeScript, a language/framework that was practically completely new to me.
However, given that I thought the project was fun and exciting, it was very easy to stay motivated to learn Angular despite how difficult and challenging it was at times.
Ultimately, I was very pleased with the whole project, as I was able to apply what I learned into something that was fun and exciting!
